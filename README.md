### A bundle of React components to use in your application!

Turborepo is an advanced build system designed for managing monorepos, which can significantly enhance the development of design systems, particularly when integrated with React.js and Storybook. This combination allows developers to create, manage, and document UI components efficiently.

## Turborepo

Turborepo facilitates the organization of multiple projects within a single repository, streamlining the build process and enabling faster incremental builds. It is particularly beneficial for large-scale applications that require consistent tooling and dependencies across various packages. By using Turborepo, developers can maintain a unified workflow for linting, building, testing, and releasing components, which is essential for design systems that rely on reusable UI elements

## Stroybook

Storybook serves as an isolated environment for developing and showcasing UI components. It allows developers to visualize components in different states and configurations, making it easier to test and document them. With Storybook, teams can create a living style guide that evolves alongside their applications. This is particularly useful in a monorepo setup, where components are shared across multiple applications
